# Aljava-Portable
JavaFX application which wraps the ffmpeg lib to provide easy and clean video and audio conversion and compression

The program provides an UI, and is currently available in PT-BR (brazilian portuguese). It's been developed to aid the web-system Aljava, which stores processes' files in a repository-like environment.

All video files have their resolutions reduced and are converted to .mp4
All audio files are encoded with libmp3lame and are saved as .mp3
